🔄 PRIVATE-PUBLIC CONTRACT INTERACTION IN PALADIN
==================================================

❓ THE PROBLEM:
==============
User created two contracts:
1. PublicStorage.sol - Deployed on public Besu chain
2. PrivateStorage.sol - Deployed in Pente privacy group

✅ WRITING works: Private contract can emit PenteExternalCall to write to public contract
❌ READING fails: Private contract cannot directly read from public contract

Error: "PD011206: DOMAIN pente returned error: transaction reverted"

🏗️ WHY THIS HAPPENS - THE FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE:
===================================================

🔴 THE KEY INSIGHT: TWO SEPARATE EVMs
=====================================
Paladin uses a "headless EVM" model where:

📍 PRIVATE EVM (Pente Domain):
   🎯 Location: Off-chain, in privacy group nodes only
   💾 State: Completely isolated private state
   🔧 Engine: Besu headless EVM instance
   👥 Access: Only privacy group members
   📊 Data: Private contract state and logic

📍 PUBLIC EVM (Base Ledger):
   🎯 Location: On-chain, on all Besu network nodes
   💾 State: Public blockchain state
   🔧 Engine: Standard Besu EVM
   👥 Access: All network participants
   📊 Data: Public contract state and transactions

❌ CRITICAL POINT: These EVMs are COMPLETELY SEPARATED!
=======================================================

🔄 THE 3-PHASE PRIVATE TRANSACTION PROCESS:
===========================================

1️⃣ ASSEMBLE PHASE:
   → Proposing node runs transaction in private EVM
   → Records input and output states
   → ❌ NO access to public EVM state during this phase
   → ✅ Uses only data available in private EVM

2️⃣ ENDORSE PHASE:
   → All group members verify the transaction
   → Each runs transaction in their private EVM
   → Confirms outputs match expected results
   → ❌ Still NO access to public EVM state
   → ✅ Deterministic execution based on private state only

3️⃣ PREPARE & SUBMIT PHASE:
   → Transaction coordinator submits to base ledger
   → Includes hashes of private inputs/outputs
   → Includes signatures from all group members
   → ✅ CAN trigger external calls to public contracts
   → ❌ CANNOT read responses back into private state

🚫 WHY DIRECT READING FAILS:
============================

When PrivateStorage tries to call:
\`\`\`solidity
uint256 publicNumber = PublicStorage(_publicStorageAddress).retrieve();
\`\`\`

❌ The private EVM tries to read from _publicStorageAddress
❌ But _publicStorageAddress exists in the PUBLIC EVM
❌ Private EVM has no connection to public EVM state
❌ Result: Transaction reverts with no data

🔄 THE "DOWNWARD FUNNEL" PRINCIPLE:
===================================

✅ ALLOWED: Private → Public (External Calls)
   📤 Private contracts can WRITE to public contracts
   🎯 Via PenteExternalCall events
   💼 Examples: Payments, state updates, notifications

❌ NOT ALLOWED: Public → Private (Direct Reads)
   📥 Private contracts CANNOT READ from public contracts
   🚫 During private EVM execution
   💼 Would break deterministic consensus

🛠️ SOLUTION 1: ORACLE PATTERN
==============================

Instead of reading during execution, feed data in at the start:

\`\`\`solidity
contract PrivateStorage is IPenteExternalCall {
    uint256 private _privateNumber;
    address private _publicStorageAddress;

    // ✅ CORRECT: Accept public data as input
    function storeWithPublicData(uint256 privateNum, uint256 publicNum) public {
        _privateNumber = privateNum;
        
        // Use the provided public data
        uint256 combinedValue = privateNum + publicNum;
        
        // Trigger external call with result
        bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(PublicStorage.store, (combinedValue));
        emit PenteExternalCall(_publicStorageAddress, data);
    }

    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256 value) {
        return _privateNumber; // Only return private data
    }
}
\`\`\`

📡 Oracle Implementation:
\`\`\`javascript
// Off-chain oracle fetches public data
const publicValue = await publicContract.retrieve();

// Feeds it into private transaction
await privateContract.storeWithPublicData(privateValue, publicValue);
\`\`\`

🛠️ SOLUTION 2: TWO-STEP PROCESS
===============================

Step 1: Read public data in separate transaction
Step 2: Use that data in private transaction

\`\`\`javascript
// Step 1: Public transaction to read current state
const currentPublicValue = await publicStorageContract.retrieve();

// Step 2: Private transaction using that data
await privateStorageContract.storeWithKnownPublicValue(
    privateValue, 
    currentPublicValue
);
\`\`\`

🛠️ SOLUTION 3: EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE
========================================

\`\`\`solidity
// Public contract emits events when state changes
contract PublicStorage {
    uint256 private _number;
    
    event NumberStored(uint256 newNumber);

    function store(uint256 num) public {
        _number = num;
        emit NumberStored(num);
    }
}

// Off-chain service listens to events and triggers private transactions
// when public state changes
\`\`\`

🆚 COMPARISON WITH TESSERA:
===========================

❌ TESSERA MODEL (Previous Generation):
   🔗 Tight coupling between private and public state
   📖 Direct reads from public contracts possible
   ⚠️ Security and consistency issues
   🐛 Race conditions and state inconsistencies
   ❓ Unclear consensus on mixed state

✅ PALADIN MODEL (Current Generation):
   🔒 Strict separation between private and public EVMs
   📤 Only unidirectional communication (private → public)
   🛡️ Deterministic consensus within privacy groups
   ✅ Clear state boundaries and consistency
   🎯 Predictable execution model

💡 KEY INSIGHTS:
================

1️⃣ ARCHITECTURAL CHOICE:
   The separation is intentional, not a limitation!
   It solves consistency and consensus problems.

2️⃣ DIFFERENT PARADIGM:
   Think "oracle input" rather than "direct read"
   Plan data flow from public to private upfront

3️⃣ BETTER SECURITY:
   No race conditions between public and private state
   Deterministic private execution

4️⃣ CLEAR BOUNDARIES:
   Explicit about what data enters private computation
   Audit trail of all external dependencies

🎯 PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
=============================

✅ DO:
   → Design private contracts to accept external data as inputs
   → Use oracle patterns to feed public data into private transactions
   → Implement event-driven architectures for state synchronization
   → Plan your data flow architecture upfront

❌ DON'T:
   → Try to read public contract state during private execution
   → Expect Tessera-like tight coupling between public/private
   → Assume you can mix public and private state directly

🔗 ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS:
=========================

🛡️ Security: No state confusion or race conditions
🎯 Predictability: Deterministic private execution
🔍 Auditability: Clear data provenance
⚖️ Consensus: Simplified agreement on private state
🏗️ Scalability: Independent EVM optimization

📚 CONCLUSION:
==============
The error occurs because Paladin intentionally separates private and public EVMs
for security and consistency. The solution is to redesign your architecture to
use oracle patterns rather than direct reads. This is a feature, not a bug!
